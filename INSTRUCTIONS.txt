SPACE INVADERS (HTML/JS) — How to run the game without Live Server (BAT/SH)

WHY THESE FILES ARE NEEDED
When you open index.html directly (double click), the browser runs it using the:
  file:///...

scheme. In this mode, modern browsers apply strict security restrictions
(CORS / Same-Origin Policy):

- fetch() to local files is blocked (JSON, binary data, etc.)
- ES module imports (type="module") may be blocked or partially restricted
- Loading assets from JavaScript can fail or behave differently
- Canvas operations can be affected when generating data (for example,
  when creating pixel masks / bitmasks from images)

In this project, this directly affects things like:
- Loading sprites, sounds, or data from JavaScript
- Any logic that builds pixel-perfect collision masks from images
- Any use of fetch(), dynamic imports, or asset preprocessing

To avoid these issues, the project must be served over HTTP, even locally:
  http://localhost:8000

When the game is served from localhost, the browser treats it as a normal
origin and CORS restrictions do not interfere. That is why we use the
run_game.bat and run_game.sh scripts: they start a local HTTP server using
Python and automatically open the correct URL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS (WINDOWS)
1) Make sure Python is installed and available in PATH.
   - Test in Command Prompt or PowerShell:
       python --version

2) Place the file:
       run_game.bat
   in the same directory as index.html.

3) Run the game:
   - Double click run_game.bat
   - Your browser will open automatically at:
       http://localhost:8000
   - The console window will stay open while the server is running.

4) To stop the server:
   - Close the console window, or press Ctrl+C inside it.

Notes:
- If port 8000 is already in use, change in run_game.bat:
    set PORT=8000
  to another port (for example 8080).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS (LINUX)
1) Make sure Python 3 is installed.
   - Test in a terminal:
       python3 --version
   (if that does not exist, try python --version)

2) Place the file:
       run_game.sh
   in the same directory as index.html.

3) Make it executable:
       chmod +x run_game.sh

4) Run the game:
       ./run_game.sh
   - Your browser will open automatically (if xdg-open is available).
   - The server will be running at:
       http://localhost:8000

5) To stop the server:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

Notes:
- If port 8000 is already in use, edit in run_game.sh:
    PORT=8000
  and change it to another port (for example 8080).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR
- Opening index.html directly uses file:// and triggers CORS restrictions.
- Running a local HTTP server (localhost) avoids those restrictions.
- run_game.bat (Windows) and run_game.sh (Linux) automate server startup and URL opening.
